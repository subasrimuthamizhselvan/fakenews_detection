Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based classifier that detects fake news articles by analyzing text data. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning models to classify news as real or fake.

📌 Features
✅ Preprocesses text data (tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization)
✅ Uses ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
✅ Achieves high accuracy using TF-IDF & CountVectorizer
✅ Web interface for user-friendly interaction (Flask/Django)

🚀 How It Works
Data Collection: Loads real & fake news datasets.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and vectorizes text using NLP.
Model Training: Trains multiple classifiers & selects the best-performing model.
Prediction: Classifies input news as Real or Fake.
Deployment: Provides a web-based UI for real-time predictions.
🛠️ Quick Setup
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn flask nltk
Run the Model:
bash
Copy
Edit
python fake_news_detection.py
Launch Web App (if using Flask):
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Test News Input: Enter a news headline/article & get a prediction.
📄 Output Example
Headline	Prediction
"Stock markets crash due to economic slowdown"	Real
"Aliens found on Mars confirm scientists"	Fake
🤖 Future Improvements
Improve accuracy using Deep Learning (LSTM, BERT)
Enhance the dataset for better generalization
Deploy on Cloud (AWS/GCP) for scalability
